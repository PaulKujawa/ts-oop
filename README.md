# TS-OOP

Private playground for OOP patterns tried out in TS.

Heavily inspired by https://springframework.guru/.

## Usage

Run via `npm start -- <path>`, e.g.
`npm start -- ./behavior/observer.ts`

## Notes

- decided to use TS modifiers over JS ones (e.g. `private foo` over `#foo`)
  as JS has no support for protected yet
